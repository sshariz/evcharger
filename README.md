# EV Charging Data - CA Counties

As EV sales make up a greater of share of new car sales with each new year, the demand for EV Charging stations will skyrocket. I've conducted analysis on CA County EV Charger counts (both public & private) in 2021 to perform an analysis on which counties are the "best" for charging based on total charger counts and the proportion of chargers per the counties population.
